#Given Task 
Full Stack Developer Mini Project
Challenge 1
Estimated time - 1.5 hours
Primary focus - API and data design, prototyping skills

Download the Wysa for Sleep app
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sleep.app.relax.calm&hl=en_IN&gl=US

Alternatively, you can also search for Wysa Sleep on the Google Play Store. Note that as of now, this app is not available for iOS, so you will have to either use the screenshots from below or borrow an Android phone for a short bit from a friend.

During the onboarding phase, the Sleep app takes you through a sleep assessment that looks like so.

Please go through the onboarding screens for a clear understanding of the task.

Now implement the following:

Design detailed REST API interaction flows (that include the request body, parameters and responses), and database schema (sql or nosql) that will be used to implement a flow like this. 
Architect and implement a React project to implement the screen. 
Support only 1 or 2 of the screens in the flow
Ensure the switching b/w the screens is happening via a (mock) server


Note: 
The api design is a REQUIRED task. Attempt the static code challenge on leetcode only after you’ve completed this. 
Please read the task description carefully before attempting.
