## Database Schema

I have used MongoDB to store the user data. The schema for the user collection can be as follows:

```
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "nickname": String,
  "goals": [String],
  "problemDuration": String,
  "sleepPattern": {
    "sleepTime": String,
    "wakeUpTime": String,
    "totalSleepHours": Number
  }
}
```

- Each user will have a unique `_id` generated by MongoDB.
- The `nickname` field will store the user's nickname and the `goals` will be an array of strings containing the user's selected goals.
- The `problemDuration` will store the user's selected duration for which they have been facing the problem, and `sleepPattern` will be an embedded document containing the user's selected sleep pattern details.
